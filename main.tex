    This work aims to provide an overview of simulations concerning the behavior of AC current carrying cables. The focus of the discussion is on the quasistatic limits of conducting matter and the analytic solutions derived for the field distributions within the cable. Additionally, the work delves into the examination of thermoelectric and mechanical stresses that are generated by the flow of currents through the cable. Through simulations, a comprehensive understanding of the intricate behaviors and effects of AC cables can be attained, aiding in the design and optimization of such systems for various applications.
